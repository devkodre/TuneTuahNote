    <h1>Welcome to TuneTuahNote</h1>
    <p>ToneTuahNote was started as a project for the premier hackathon at Purdue University: BoilerMake XII (in 2025).</p>
    <p>What started as just an interactive piano evolved into a full fledged web application combining AI and music.</p>
    <p>You can also record and stop recording and play back what you inputted.</p>
    <p>Our main feature is a generative music tool where our website takes in your input and returns some generated music added to the end.</p>
